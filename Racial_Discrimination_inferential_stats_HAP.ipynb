    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Hiring managers have a big influence on the fates of job applicants. Unconcious biases held by individuals who process job applications may have long-term effects on who gets hired and thus employee diversity (or lack thereof). In a study of 4870 resumes sent to companies, we confirmed racial bias against applications with African American-sounding names. In our study, where 'black-sounding' and 'white-sounding names were randomly assigned to identical resumes, the proportion of 'black' resumes receiving follow-up calls from hiring managers (0.06) was significantly lower than the proportion of 'white' resumes (0.1) receiving calls (z = 4.108, p = 0.00). We recommend hiring managers incorporate strict practices to prevent biased hiring such as removing names, and even ages from visible resume fields during application reviews."

    "* __Amend analysis__: This study was designed specifically to test for effects of racial bias on resume success. It is important not to try to find other, unrelated effects hidden in the data that were not originally addressed by the study design. However, there could be combined factors that further elucidate concious and unconcious bias of hiring managers. For example the difference in proportions in sub-groups of applicants could be even more different than for the whole pool of applicants (e.g., women, certain types of positions, entry level positions, etc.)."
