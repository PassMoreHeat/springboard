    "### 1. Introduction and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "When consumers consider purchasing a product, they often turn to reviews and ratings submitted by other customers to determine if the purchase is worthwhile. Conversely, retailers depend on honest and accurate reviews and ratings to ensure subsequent buyers can make informed purchases. Like business ratings, product ratings and reviews also affect sales. Therefore, accurate and error-free reviews and ratings are extremely valuable to retailers. The sentiment captured in the text of a review should be reflected in the star rating. One-star ratings potentially have a big negative effect on sales, so retailers need tools to flag incongruous reviews and ratings that may indicate user error. Similarly, high ratings paired with scathing review text may indicate errors or other issues with the product or review system. Can we predict ratings whether ratings are high or low based on review features? I used Natural Language Processing methods and fit machine learning algorithms to training data to predict high and low reviews in testing data. With scikit-learn's feature selection tools I identify text features most associated with high and low ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both consumers and vendors depend on reviews and ratings to make informed decisions about purchases and to help with sales. Positive and negative ratings and reviews help buyers and sellers know what to spend money on and what products to avoid. Errors and inconsistencies in these assessments can directly affect sales and customer satisfaction. Here I use features of consumer book review text to determine if reviews can predict ratings. Being able to predict ratings based on review features has multiple benefits for potential clients: 1) catch errors by reviewers where they accidentally selected the wrong number of stars, 2) suggest ratings when reviewers do not provide a star rating along with their review, 3) flag confusing/incongruous review-rating pairs for revision (by reviewer) or so that they are not featured first in review lists, and potentially 4) identify and flag reviews and ratings that are ‘fake’ or jokes based on the text of the review.\n",

    "### 2. Client Profile and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "My preliminary clients are retailers. From bookstores to toy stores and to large online retailers of many categories, retailers depend on consumer reviews to 1) make decisions on what products to purchase for resale and 2) to promote sales from their platform. The machine learning algorithm can be used by retailers internally or as part of their review platform used by consumers. I envision a review platform that facilitates consumer review writing. This platform could incorporate a text editor (like Grammarly) to help reviewers craft clear and effective reviews in addition to suggesting a rating level based on the specific rating system of a given platform. Together these features will help reviewers communicate more clearly and select corresponding ratings more consistently. The algorithm parameters would be tuned and adjusted based on the product categories and also based on prior customer input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, my machine-learning algorithm that predicts high and low ratings from review text features can be utilized for any product-category or business. Further, interpreting the sentiment of consumer input has value beyond rating systems. Businesses benefit from understanding customer responses to products, interactions with customer service, assessments of online resources, and many other customer-business interactions. A system that identifies positive and negative feedback from potential or actual customers can give businesses the power to intercede and to improve customer engagement and satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my Capstone project I acquired a large dataset of reviews and ratings, subsetted a specific genre of book reviews, explored quantitative and qualitative patterns within reviews and ratings, preprocessed and cleaned review text, grouped reviews into binary ratings categories, and fit machine learning algorithms to subsetted training data in order to test algorithms and parameters on testing data. These initial steps are the foundation for further development of tools to facilitate effective review writing and consistent rating assignments by consumers."

Some of the top 25 words are also genre-specific terms related to science, information and the real world. This word frequency graph also reveals that normalization of tokens is not complete at this stage. In later steps of pre-processing the data, I will utilize a text stemmer to reduce redundant words like 'book' and 'books' from appearing separately. Although I removed stopwords before creating this word frequency chart, later I will add additional stop words to the list to remove words that do not add meaning or are very frequent across all reviews (e.g., book, books, read, reading).

I tested the null hypothesis that word counts are equal between the two 'high' and 'low' rating categories. To make comparisons between the rating groups I first log-transformed the word count data to address non-normal distributions and performed an independent two-sample t-test for unequal variances. Results of this test on the log-transformed word counts indicate that the word count of all 1-star through 4-star rated reviews is significantly higher than 'five-star' rated reviews (t = 15.5, p = 0.00).\n",

For comparison between rating categories, I calculated the percentage of words in uppercase from the total number of words per review. There are many small values of percent uppercase words for both rating groups - my methods captured words like 'I' and 'A' and individual words written in uppercase for emphasis. When I considered reviews with 25% or more uppercase words there were 32 5-star reviews and only seven reviews of 4-stars or fewer. The statistical comparison between these two groups indicates there is no difference between the five-star and 1 to 4-star percentages of uppercase words.

    "### 6. Machine Learning\n",
    "The motivation for machine learning (ML) on the dataset of consumer book ratings and book review text is to classify new review text as either a high rated book (5-star) or low rated book (4 or fewer stars). Following exploratory data analysis and inferential statistical comparisons of ratings and reviews, the first step towards machine learning is to pre-process the text data through normalization methods. Following pre-processing I divided the review data into training and testing datasets. In order for the computer to process and compare elements of high and low rated reviews the text data must be vectorized. Vectorization tools transform the corpus of review text into a vector of words. For each review, the count or frequency of each vocabulary element is encoded. Many cells in this matrix will be zero - these are sparse vectors. Prior to fitting and comparing different ML algorithms I applied and compared two vectorization methods: CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer from the scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al. 2011). I selected the best performing vectorization method and proceeded to fit, tune and compare algorithms for predicting book ratings on unseen reviews (the test dataset)."

    "My exploratory data analysis of word frequencies revealed several elements of review text that needed attention before the data were ready for machine learning. Even after removing stop words the most common word in all Science textbook reviews was 'book' which was used about 16,000 times more than the next most common word 'read'. Neither word has a negative or positive meaning in the context of book reviews, so they could be added to the stop words list. Ultimately, I removed 'book' and 'books' along with other stop words (see details below) but left 'read' since bigrams using 'read' are potentially meaningful within reviews (Table 2; i.e., 'this is a good read' or 'she is a well-read author').\n",

Initial machine learning tests revealed that by removing the word 'not' along with 178 'english' stopwords with NLTK (Loper et al. 2002) my models tended to classify most sample reviews as 'high' rated reviews. This is the result of losing bigram features with the negation word 'not'. While 'not' is common in both high and low rated reviews the meaning of the bigrams 'not good' and 'not bad' are distinct. First, I put NLTK's 'english' stopwords into a set and removed 'not'.

    "###### _Background_\n",
    "Different vectorizers encode text data using different methods. Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer builds a vocabulary based on the tokens in the training data and counts the occurrence of each token encoded in a sparse vector for each observation (review). Count Vectorizer allows us to take a \"bag-of-words\" approach to text analysis. The vectorized text is analyzed based on word counts, but cannot take text structure into account. A vectorizer that takes into account more information than simple token counts is the TfidfVectorizer which applies the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency to calculate token frequencies using the test data tokens. Specifically, Term Frequency is the frequency of a given token within a document while Inverse Term Frequency is used to reduce the effect of tokens that are very common across all documents. The TfidfVectorizer learns both the vocabulary as well as the inverse document frequency weights. \n",

    "To compare the effect of these two vectorizers on the book review document vocabularies I instantiated both CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer separately and saved the resulting document-term matrices from the fit and transform steps of vectorization on the X_train and X_test matrices.  For the initial comparison, I used the default parameters for both vectorizers. Next, I instantiated a Naive Bayes classifier, MultinomialNB(), and trained it on the X_train document-term matrix and y_train (the corresponding binary rating vector) from both vectorizers. I made class predictions with the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using the X_test document-term matrices, calculated scores to compare models, and used GridSearchCV to select the best parameters for the simple Naive Bayes model. For CountVectorizer the apparent best parameters were the default parameters while for TfidfVectorizer the best alpha value was 0.1 (Table 3). Updating alpha for TfidfVectorizer and re-running the classifier resulted in a higher ROC-AUC score as well and improved prediction counts in the confusion matrix. Next, I re-parameterized the two vectorizers to include bigrams (ngram_range = (1,2)) and increased the default minimum document frequency (min_df) for the vectorizers to three. These parameters increased the area under the ROC curve and grid search indicated that the default Multinomail Naive Bayes parameters were best (Table 3).\n",

A test of classification accuracy by the current model on made-up review text including negation terms (e.g., 'not good' or 'not bad') reveals that this simple model tends to classify text into the 'high' rating category (Table 4). For the following simple test reviews, all made-up reviews are assigned to the 'high' review rating category. With the current model, I had to work hard to write a review that rated as 'low' rating category.

    "#### 6.3. Model Comparison\n",
    "Using primarily the document-terms matrix from the TF-IDF vectorization (with the ngram_range set to 1-2 and min_df = 3) I fit and tuned four classification algorithms. In addition, with the exception of Multinomial Naive Bayes, for each classifier I included the parameter class_weight='balanced' to address target class imbalance in the input data. To compare models I report the area under the ROC curve (scoring = ROC_AUC) for all models (Table 5). For one model, SGDClassifier, I used the document-terms matrix from the CountVectorizer (with ngram_range = (1,2), min_df = 3) in place of TfidfVectorization because the tfidf training vector was not compatible with the algorithm. The SGDClassifier is recommended in lieu of Support Vector Machines for fitting large-scale linear classifiers without having to copy complex arrays as input (Pedregosa et al. 2011). With the exception of LogisticRegressionCV, I implemented GridSearchCV for cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for all models. The ROC_AUC values in Table 5 are the scores following parameter tuning based on the best parameter output from GridSearchCV. The highest scoring model is LogisticRegressionCV which adjusts regularization parameter C automatically by selecting the best hyperparameter by the cross-validator StratifiedKFold from the grid of Cs values set by default to be ten values in a logarithmic scale between 1e-4 and 1e4 (Pedregosa et al. 2011). The area of the true positive vs true negative rates (0.80) is highest for the LogisticRegressionCV model (Figure 7).\n",

Some tokens with the low weights were obviously negative and may be associated with reviews in the 'low' category: 'unfortun', 'bore', and 'disappoint'.

    "The most successful approach to review text classification for this genre-specific subset of Amazon reviews involved Logistic Regression classification with a built-in cross-validation tool. The normalization steps leading to the best model included preprocessing by lowercaseing all words, removing numbers and punctuation, removing a user-determined set of stopwords which did not include 'not', word tokenization and stemming all tokens with SnowballStemmer. Document-terms were produced with vectorization and Tf-idf of words and bigrams. \n",
    "\n",
    "Applied to the test data the LogisticRegressionCV classifier (with the regularization parameter C automatically tuned to Cs=10) correctly classified 1540 reviews in the 'high' rating category and 651 reviews in the 'low' rating category. Another 696 reviews were misclassified false negatives (n=376) or false positives (n=320). These counts were better than other models and resulted in the higher area under the curve for the ROC curve of true positive rate vs. false positive rate for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the various models on made-up positive and negative review text illustrates that many of the tested algorithms classify the majority of novel review text as 'low' rated reviews. However, the tuned LogisticRegressionCV model (as well as RandomForestClassifier and SGDC) appropriately classified very negative review text in the 'low' rating category and the paired positive text as 'high'. This indicates some success towards building an accurate classifier for this genre of book reviews. One curious change that resulted from adjustments to pre-processing (keeping the word 'not' in the document terms) and model parameterization (setting class_weights to 'balanced' to address imbalanced target classes) was that the models shifted from a tendency to classify text into the 'high' class to almost exclusively classifying text as the 'low' class. Further adjustments would likely improve the predictive models. In addition, work with separate sets of genre-specific reviews could help me tune and improve this classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline with Random Forest Classifier also performed well classifying review data. This is a promising model and with additional parameter tuning could out-perform the LogisticRegressionCV model. However, GridSearchCV ran very slowly and I was only able to search with limited numbers of parameters and parameter values at a time."

    "My final classification model using LogisticRegression with cross-validation on bag-of-words and bigrams classifies many Amazon reviews with 5-star ratings correctly as 'high' rated and many Amazon book reviews associated with lower ratings as 'low' rated. This accuracy of classification is a great step towards building tools for product review writing and rating. There are many more steps that could improve this project and other steps for potential work down the road towards developing tools for product reviews. With more time and resources I would address some of these limitations in my next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps & future directions:\n",
    "* Rating classes are imbalanced, with more 'high' ratings than 'low' ratings. In addition to, or in place of setting the class_weight parameter to 'balanced', explore other methods to deal with imbalanced classes. To balance classes as resampled X and y, use SMOTE: imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.\n",
    "* My Amazon review database also includes short 'summary' text along with reviews. These short phrases may be more explicitly focused on the gist of the review. \n",
    "    * Test product summary text with the best model from review analysis. Summaries are short and to-the-point. Can we predict rating category with the summary text based on the review vocabulary? Do we improve our prediction success?\n",
    "* Access another subset of reviews from a different genre. Perform similar steps to build a machine learning algorithm to predict rating category. How different is the new model?\n",
    "* Cross-test the best models for each genre of reviews on the review text for the opposite set of reviews. Do the models perform better or worse on unique review vocabularies?\n",
    "* Explore word embeddings with Word2vec to model reviews with two-layer neural networks.\n",
    "* Re-assign 5-star Amazon review ratings to different binary rating categories. \n",
    "    * In an analysis of fine food reviews from Amazon, Data Scientist Susan Li divided reviews into high (4 & 5-star) and low (1 & 2-star) and removed the 3-star reviews based on the assumption that they are neutral (Li 2017).\n",
    "    * Building a model based on only very negative (1-star) and very positive (5-star) reviews may lead to more accurate predictions. However, in the large Amazon book review database and in my Science Textbook subset 1-star reviews are very uncommon. Getting enough of a vocabulary for low rated reviews would be difficult.\n",
