# Springboard Repository
Repository of data science mini-projects and Capstones completed by Heather A. Passmore for Springboard's Data Science Career Track Workshop. Completed July 2018.

# Description
This repository contains exploratory data analyses, mini-project notebooks, take-home challenge work, and two complete Capstone projects for the Springboard Data Science Career Track curriculum. My Capstone projects address classification tasks using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.
