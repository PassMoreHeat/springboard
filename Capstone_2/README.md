# Determine factors causing vessel delays at US Army Corps of Engineers-managed locks on US waterways.
Second Capstone for Springboard Career Track

## Summary and Motivation
The inland waterways of the United States are highways for domestic and foreign commerce. Commodities carried on barges and container ships move up and down US rivers and pass through locks owned and/or operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The Institute of Water Resources (IWR) within USACE collects data to document vessel transit through the 192 locks on 38 rivers and waterways. The Lock Performance Monitoring System (LPMS) developed and used by USACE holds both lockage information (including number of barges processed, direction of vessel traffic, and lock and chamber details) and event timing data (vessel arrival time, processing time and delay time). Various factors may affect delay times for vessel passage through locks including the age and maintenance status of individual locksas well as weather events, season, vessel traffic, or vessel features. The consequences of delays, or worse, failures of locks, are serious. 

Vessel traffic on US waterways and through USACE-managed locks plays an important role in the transport of foreign and domestic goods into and out of the US. Locks are owned and operated by the US Army Corps of Engineers, range in age from 14 to 144 years since construction, and are considered by many to have surpassed their life-expectancy. Delays and failures of locks have immediate financial implications for shipping companies and for the USACE. Using a dataset of vessel traffic through 193 locks on 38 rivers over a five-year period I will explore patterns and use supervised learning and regression to determine conditions that lead to delays in lockage at individual locks. I am specifically interested in modeling delays and generally focused on identifying cost-based consequences to trends in lock operations. 

My predictive models of lockage delays will be useful internally to USACE for planning and scheduling as well as externally to inform stakeholders. USACE makes some of their lock data available to the public through the LPMS Public Web. They also produce annual reports for related topics like Waterborne Container Traffic, Commodity Indicators, Ports and State Data, Domestic Waterborne Traffic by Commerce Type, etc. Results of my analysis may inform some of this publicly shared analysis of US waterways traffic and locks.
